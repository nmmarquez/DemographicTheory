# General Demographic Overview  

## Background  
Demographic research lies at the nexus of social science research and shares much in common with other fields. The overlap between demography and other fields often puts it in a difficult place in terms of solidfying it's place as a unique field. This may be esepcially true in the current era of large scale data production where research concerning "populations" is used by a larger number of research fields. These large N studies allow for more detailed divisions and subpopulations within a particular population to be studied. While one could imagine a scenario where this could drain demography of its standing while other fields take over the space it once occupied this seems not to bve the case. The expnasion of data has come alongside an expansion in those that  take a demographic mindset into their analysis and incoporate demographic methds in their study. It may be because of this that we have seen a relative growth in the size of instutions in the United States that are associated with demographic research, while at the same time a collopsing down in the size of the number of academic institutions that house a proper school of demography @Xie2000. In order to best summarize how we arrived at the current state of demography research I will discuss and review a brief series of papers that cover the history of demographic research in the 20 and 21st century, with particular attention to the development of the field in the United States.  

## Formal Demography and Population Studies  

It is likely impossible to find a credible account of the history of demography in the United States without acknowledging Hauser and Duncan 1959 piece _The Study of Population_. The work attempted to establish demography as a legitimate social science and the particular research domains for which the field holds a special claim to. Though the work spans nearly 900 pages the often most cited passage comes to us as the direct, albeit vauge, statement of what constitutes the field of demography. Hauser and Duncan state _Demography is the study of the size, territorial distribution, and composition of population, changes therein, and the components of such change._ While not stated specfifcally here the elements that constitute population changes in a society can be traced back to the fors of the demographic balancing equation, namely the increase contributed by births and the decreases attributed to death. If we subdivide our population into specific geographic areas then we must also consider how populations move in space and how these spaces may differentially experience births and deaths and thus, the particular focus that is placed on _territorial distribution_. How the age distribution of deaths, and the age of and number of children, predominately, woman have are "shaped", ie their age distributions, and how that shape changes are at the heart of what is now considered formal demography. On the other hand we have population process and social demography. This set of demography is more interested in the social drivers that alter the distributions of mortality, fertility, and migration. The distinction between the two fields has seen development of theoretical opposition happen in one field even if it was at the disnmay of the other, a topic that I will touch on further in this reprt.  

Whether the distinction between these two fields is helpful or not it's seperation has helped shape the current state of the demographic field. Perhaps one of the most influential aspects from the formal demographic group has been the development of age-specfic profilles of mortality and feryility and their relationship to developmental change in what is known as the demographic transition. Briefly the demographic transition states that as a country develops in it's technologies and economic infrastructures
